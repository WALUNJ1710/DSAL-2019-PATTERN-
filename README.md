# DSAL-2019-PATTERN-These are the practicals od Second-year Computer engineering DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHM LABORATORY Assignment 

Assignment 01 
 Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table
implementation to quickly look up clientâ€˜s telephone number. Make use of two collision 
handling techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a 
set of telephone numbers

Assignment 02
 A book consists of chapters, chapters consist of sections and sections consist of 
subsections. Construct a tree and print the nodes. Find the time and space requirements 
of your method.

Assignment 03
 Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression eg. +--a*bc/def and 
traverse it using post order traversal (non recursive) and then delete the entire tree. 

Assignment 04
  A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new
keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display 
whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum
comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Binary Search Tree for 
implementation.

Assignment 05
  Represent a given graph using adjacency matrix/list to perform DFS and using adjacency 
list to perform BFS. Use the map of the area around the college as the graph. Identify 
the prominent land marks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that. 

Assignment 06
  You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines to connect them
up with each other; and the phone company charges different amounts of money to 
connect different pairs of cities. You want a set of lines that connects all your offices 
with a minimum total cost. Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures

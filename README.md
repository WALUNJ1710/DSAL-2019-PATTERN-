# DSAL-2019-PATTERN-These are the practicals od Second-year Computer engineering DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHM LABORATORY Assignment 

Assignment 01 
  
  Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table
implementation to quickly look up client‘s telephone number. Make use of two collision 
handling techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a 
set of telephone numbers

Assignment 02

 To create ADT that implement the "set" concept. 
a. Add (new Element) -Place a value into the set , b. Remove (element) Remove the 
value 
c. Contains (element) Return true if element is in collection, d. Size () Return number of 
values in collection Iterator () Return an iterator used to loop over collection, e. 
Intersection of two sets , f. Union of two sets, g. Difference between two sets, h. Subset


Assignment 03
  
  
  A book consists of chapters, chapters consist of sections and sections consist of 
subsections. Construct a tree and print the nodes. Find the time and space requirements 
of your method.

Assignment 04
 
 Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression eg. +--a*bc/def and 
traverse it using post order traversal (non recursive) and then delete the entire tree. 

Assignment 05
  
  A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new
keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display 
whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum
comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Binary Search Tree for 
implementation.

Assignment 06
 
 Represent a given graph using adjacency matrix/list to perform DFS and using adjacency 
list to perform BFS. Use the map of the area around the college as the graph. Identify 
the prominent land marks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that. 

Assignment 07
  
  You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines to connect them
up with each other; and the phone company charges different amounts of money to 
connect different pairs of cities. You want a set of lines that connects all your offices 
with a minimum total cost. Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures

Assignment 08
 
 Given sequence k = k1 <k2 < … <kn of n sorted keys, with a search probability pi for each 
key ki . Build the Binary search tree that has the least search cost given the access 
probability for each key?

Assignment 09

 A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new
keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display 
whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum
comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Height balance tree and find the 
complexity for finding a keyword 

Assignment 10

 Consider a scenario for Hospital to cater services to different kinds of patients as Serious 
(top priority), b) non-serious (medium priority), c) General Checkup (Least priority). 
Implement the priority queue to cater services to the patients. 

Assignment 11

 Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name, 
division and address. Allow user to add, delete information of student. Display 
information of particular employee. If record of student does not exist an appropriate 
message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student details. Use sequential 
file to main the data.

Assignment 12

 Company maintains employee information as employee ID, name, designation and 
salary. Allow user to add, delete information of employee. Display information of 
particular employee. If employee does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If
it is, then the system displays the employee details. Use index sequential file to maintain 
the data.
